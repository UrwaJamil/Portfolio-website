                    <p>I completed my Matric in Science at National Garrison Secondary School, Rahim Yar Khan 64200.
                        There, I balanced my time between the debate team and the basketball court. These two roles
                        really complemented each other. Debate sharpened my communication skills, while basketball
                        taught me the true meaning of leadership and teamwork under pressure.

                        start. A major turning point was my first exhibition in the 1st semester, where my IoT-based
                        project was appreciated by a professor. This ignited my confidence and set me on a path of
                        active participation in over five events, including workshop, seminars and courses,
                        significantly boosting my communication and presentation skills.This momentum propelled my
                        technical evolution from frontend development to backend, and now to my core expertise in
                        Machine Learning and Computer Vision, all while maintaining a strong CGPA of 3.4+ through
                        practical application.</p>

                    <h3>Internship</h3>
                    <p>I was selected for a Python Developer Internship at Sharplite Solutions in June 2025, where I had
                        the opportunity to work on cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision projects. I
                        developed robust ML models and implemented advanced image processing solutions, working with
                        object detection and image classification systems. This experience significantly enhanced my
                        technical expertise in AI and computer vision applications. Following this, I was offered a
                        Software Developer Intern position at Tech Savvy in August 2025, where I contributed to
                        comprehensive software solutions, collaborated with agile teams, and gained valuable experience
                        across the entire software development lifecycle in a professional setting.

                    <h4>Python Developer</h4>
                    <p>As a Python Developer, I leverage Python’s versatility and extensive libraries to build software
                        solutions that are efficient, scalable, and adaptable to real-world needs. I focus on writing
                        clean, reusable code while applying software engineering best practices that ensure long-term
                        maintainability and high performance. My expertise includes using Python for automation, data
                        handling, and development, enabling me to deliver solutions that are both reliable
                        and user-friendly. I aim to bridge the gap between technical efficiency and practical usability
                        in every project.</p>

                        interfaces to robust backend systems. I focus on creating smooth UIs, connecting them with
                        secure backends through APIs, and ensuring seamless data flow between the two. My approach
                        blends front-end usability with backend strength, enabling me to deliver solutions that are
                        scalable, reliable, and optimized for real-world performance. By handling the full cycle, from
                        interface design to backend integration, I create software that is intuitive for users while
                        remaining stable and high-performing under the hood.</p>
